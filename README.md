About
-----
The project is part of a hypothetical STEM unit that was conceived for EDC488's assessment 1. 

The product documented here is one part of this hypothetical unit's project, where students are to come up with a solution that is part of said project.

The product is the culmination of different classes and covering the building of different electric circuits, some of which included an Arduino Uno.

The artefact is a possible solution to the project's product production brief students would be given. The artefact is part of EDC488's assessment 1 brief asking for the creation of a product that might be built in the STEM unit developed for this assessment.
